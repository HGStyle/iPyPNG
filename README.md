# iPyPNG

Convert real PNGs to Apple fake PNG (CgBI).

This is basically the reverse of venjye's PyiPNG (I forked it so people could see it).

Original (reverse) project: [https://github.com/venjye/PyiPNG](https://github.com/venjye/PyiPNG)

NOTE: Code was mostly made by an LLM, but was tested and found to be working on the providen example
